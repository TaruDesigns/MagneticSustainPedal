## Repairs for the F-30 pedal in the VPC1 and other keyboards
The F-30 pedal by Fatar is a 3  pedal unit included in some high end MIDI keyboards, with the Kawai VPC1 being a popular one. This pedal tends to fail after a while so I compiled all the repairs/upgrades onto this repository. The PDFs explains all of these upgrades.

### Magnetic sensor
One of the fixes involves making a custom circuit for one of the pedals. The files for this circuit are to be used with EAGLE, but I've also included the CAM Job so you can order the PCB online.

### Updates

I'm happy with my fix, however, if you try any of the other fixes, feel free to contact me and I will add it to the repo
